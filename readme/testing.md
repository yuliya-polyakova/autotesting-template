Testing new functionality

Testing takes place at all stages of the software lifecycle:
1. Requirement Clarification: Based on the draft version of the specification, a discussion meeting is planned. After the
   meeting, the testing department begins drafting a checklist.
2. Requirement Verification: Once the specification is finalized, the checklist is filled up with test cases.
3. Development: During the software development phase, there's an update and addition of test cases.
4. Demo: A demonstration of the working product service is held for the entire team
5. Running Unit Testing: A tester runs Unit tests on DEV environment
6. Functional testing: Passing the test according to prepared scenarios and describing bugs in the tracker found during testing (the first cycle of testing).
7. Implementation Autotests: Creating automated scripts based on the described test cases.
8. Bugfixing: Checking bugs found as a result of the first testing cycle. The second testing cycle should include fixing all critical issues, and major issues, and preparing a minimum viable product.
9. Verification of the automated regression testing process.
10. Release Protocol: Preparation of a test certificate confirming the product's readiness for deployment.
11. Release notes and documentation. Preparing release notes and documentation for the new feature, including user manuals, technical documentation, and all relevant test cases.
12. Drawing up a Rollback Plan: A plan to prepare to undo changes if unforeseen issues arise after deployment in the production environment.
13. Release to production: Signatures of all those responsible for the release protocol and roll out to the production, checking that the required version is rolled out to the production
14. User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Collecting feedback from users, and adding the necessary requirements to the next release.
